<h1>Development Review</h1>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>My development process was to first figure out the layout of the webpage, the ids that would be called, and where edits to the table would be made. Then I created a javascript file and made a function to add to an array based on user input. Then I made a function to display these results. Slowly, I added more functions, making it have more features but also be more modular and complex. To help me keep track of everything, I would add comments to certain lines that seemed confusing at first, or I would separate a part into a separate function. Of course, during this whole process, I tested my results in the browser regularly.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>I faced <b>A LOT</b> of challenges when trying to make my code. Most of them had to do with forgetting a simple rule or logic, such as putting a function that calls and object that doesn't exist yet, calling a local variable from a different function that can't access that variable, or deleting a variable by reintializing it. Some other problems included the Date picker not working because I forgot to include the css file, not including parentheses when calling a jquery function, and putting a return statement too soon in a function.</p>

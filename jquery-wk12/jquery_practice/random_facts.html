	<h2><a href="#">Why does grass make us itch?</a></h2>
	 <div class="hide">
	 <p>Usually it's because tiny edges and bristles on the grass make small cuts on your skin, causing slight itching. You probably can't see the cuts,but they are called "blades" of grass for that reason.</p>

	 <h2><a href="#">Where did the word ketchup come from?</a></h2>
	  <div class="hide">
	  <p>The most popular theory is that the word ketchup was derived from "koe-chiap" or "ke-tsiap" in the Amoy dialect of China, where it meant the brine of pickled fish or shellfish. Some people prefer the Malayan word "kechap" (spelled ketjap by the Dutch), which may have come from the Chinese in the first place.</p>

	 <h2><a href="#">Is chalk a mineral?</a></h2>
	  <div class="hide">
	  <p>Chalk is a soft, white, porous sedimentary rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is calcium carbonate or CaCO3. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite plates (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores.</p>
